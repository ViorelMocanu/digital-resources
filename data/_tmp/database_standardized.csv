Massachusetts Institute of Technology has always been associated with major scientific and technological breakthroughs. But the breakthroughs alone do not explain the impact that MIT has had on the world. For that we have to look at entrepreneurship, which starts with the ""Mens et Manus"" (Mind and Hand) slogan on the Great Seal of MIT. For faculty, students, and alumni, MIT is all about making discoveries and inventions and then applying these discoveries and inventions to solve real problems. In a very tangible way, MIT faculty and graduates invent the future, and entrepreneurship???the building of new businesses???is often the road to that future.??  [Watch this video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkDqpBctfA) to entrepreneurship at MIT.  The report ???[Entrepreneurship and Innovation at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/innovate/entrepreneurship2015.pdf)??? examines the impact of MIT graduates who have founded and built for-profit companies. The report estimates that, as of 2014, living MIT alumni have launched more than 30,000 active companies, creating some 4.6 million jobs and generating $1.9 trillion in annual revenue. The cumulative result is the equivalent of the 10th largest economy in the world. This rich legacy of high-impact companies spans a wide range of industries; recent examples include A123 Systems, Akamai, iRobot, InVivo Therapeutics and Dropbox.  The following courses represent a selection of the entrepreneurship-related courses offered at MIT. The courses are organized in two ways: **Core courses**, the starting points for entrepreneurs and **Supplemental courses**, important once the basics have been mastered  Those interested in a general introduction to entrepreneurship as taught at MIT should visit [*15.390 New Enterprises*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-390-new-enterprises-spring-2013) and [*15.S21 Nuts and Bolts of Business Plans*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s21-nuts-and-bolts-of-business-plans-january-iap-2014).

Many applications on mobile devices or on the desktop require up-to-date data too. And so do modern web applications, built with Angular, React or Blazor. APIs are used to exchange data and these we can build using the ASP.NET Core API framework, part of ASP.NET Core.   In this path, you will learn how to build ASP.NET Core APIs from the ground up, all the way to being an expert in delivering secure and robust APIs for your customers.   First you will learn about the concepts of REST and the fundamentals of ASP.NET Core APIs. Once you have understood these, you will explore the different aspects of APIs built with ASP.NET Core in much more depth. Securing these APIs is a crucial task and you will see how to apply authentication and authorization to create a secure environment for users using your API. You will also learn how to add logging to the API and well as how to monitor an API. Then you will explore how your API can be made developer-friendly by using Swagger and adding the right documentation. You???ll all gain practical knowledge of how to create the combination of a React app that relies on an ASP.NET Core API for its data. You???ll also learn about more advanced concepts including how to increase throughput by creating asynchronous APIs as well as advanced scenarios around OpenID Connect and deploying your API in combination with Azure API Management. Finally, the Minimal API approach to building APIs with ASP.NET Core is also covered in this path.   Once you have completed this path, you can use your knowledge to explore the other application frameworks in the ASP.NET Core family. Using the courses in the ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET Core Razor Pages paths, you can learn how to create server-side web applications. You???ll see that many of the concepts you see in this path are similar or even identical for other ASP.NET Core technologies.","https://pluralsight2.imgix.net/paths/images/asp-dot-net-862e3669aa.png"
