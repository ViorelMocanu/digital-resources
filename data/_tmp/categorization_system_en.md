Please transform the following Markdown structure into a CSV.

The Markdown describes a categorization system for a website that will contain various links to 3rd party resources that help people develop new skills in various areas from design to front end, from marketing to databases, etc.

Please treat the main headers as "sections", e.g. "Alte resurse digitale" is a section.

Please treat the first level list items as "categories", e.g. "Freelancing" is a category of the "Alte resurse digitale" section.

Please treat the second level list items as "subcategories", e.g. "Fundamentele testării" is a subcategory of the "Testare manuală (MQA) și automată (AQA)" category.

Where you find "???" please make your own suggestions of items that could be placed in the taxonomy system, considering we are building a resource website aimed to help people develop skills in various fields. Please keep the list of added items relatively short. Also, please add the additional items in Romanian too.

The end result should be a CSV file with the following structure: taxonomy_id (which should auto-increment), taxonomy_title (the name of the section, category or subcategory), taxonomy_type (section or category or subcategory), taxonomy_parent (the id of the parent item, with sections having this field null).

Here is the Markdown:
